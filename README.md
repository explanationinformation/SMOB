# SMOB Addon

SMOB is a fun little Minecraft Bedrock addon built around Super Mario–inspired mobs and behaviors. It’s a small project, originally made for an Addon Jam, that focuses on simple custom entities with personality.

## Features

### Ankle Biter

A tiny, squishy enemy with a familiar temperament. Walks around, gets mad when you get close, and exists purely to be bullied.

### Chomper

A chompy plant lurking in the world. It shoots fireballs, snaps shut, and adds a bit of cartoon danger to the world.

### Yellow Box

A loot box that acts as a themed container. Break it to get ingots, diamonds, and other useful goodies.

Future updates may refine behaviors, add more mobs, or expand the gameplay loop.
